# SaveYourJobs
An automation script for job parsing where you don't need to click the web page to see what is available.

How it works: Run main.py and just add up the URL. Based on what the job portal is, the script will give an output of job, company and location.
In future I plan to add more scripts for more job portals and offer an Excel creation.

So far: Added LinkedIn Search, LinkedIn Specific Posting and Indeed Specific Posting parsing options.
